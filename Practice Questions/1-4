1.What is []?

An empty list.

2.How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored 
in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)

spam.append('hello')

For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list 
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

3.What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)] evaluate to?

It evaluates to 'd'

4.What does spam[-1] evaluate to?

It also evaluates to 'd', because its using -1 to indicate the last value on the list.

5.What does spam[:2] evaluate to?

it evaluates to:
['a', 'b']

printing the first value up to the second one.

For the following three questions, 
let’s say bacon contains the list  [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6.What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?

It prints out the index at which the string 'cat' can be found, which would be 2

7.What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

It simply adds that value to the end of the list

8.What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

When remove is called on a list and the item can be found more than once, the first item is the one thats removed.

9.What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?



10.What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?

In append you add the value to the end of the list.
While in insert, you specify the index along with the value.

11.What are two ways to remove values from a list?

You can use the 'del' keyword where you specify the index, or you can use the remove method where you can specify the value.

12.Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.

They are both mutable.
It could be said that a string is merely a list of letters joined together.
They can be indexed and accesed.
13.What is the difference between lists and tuples?

List can be modified and changed while tuples cannot.

14.How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?

var = (42, )

We add the comma at the end to indicate its a tuple.

15.How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?

You can use the list() and tuple() functions.

16.Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?

They contain references, which means if a value is removed or added, the same thing happens to the orignal.

17.What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

copy.copy() will copy the list to a variable and copy.deepcopy() will copy the inner list as well.
