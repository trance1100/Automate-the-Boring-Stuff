Q:4. The string value "Howl's Moving Castle" is a valid string. Why isn’t it a problem that the single quote character in the word Howl's isn’t escaped?

Typically in python a string ends when the starting single quote or double quote is met.
In this case the string starts in double quotes and so it doesn't cause a problem when a single quote is used.
If a single quote were used you could just escape the single quote and it wont cause any problems.
