1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

True 
False

2.What are the three Boolean operators?

&& AND
|| OR
!= Not equal to

3.Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

&& 
0 - 0 - 0
1 - 0 - 0
0 - 1 - 0
1 - 1 - 1

||
0 - 0 - 0
1 - 0 - 1
0 - 1 - 1
1 - 1 - 0

!= 

0 - 1
1 - 0

4.What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)    - False
not (5 > 4) 			- False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)		- True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))  - False
(True and True) and (True == False)  - False
(not False) or (not True)  - True

5.What are the six comparison operators?

>
< 
>=
<= 
== 
!=

6.What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assign-ment operator? 

The equal operators is for comparison.
The assignment is to store a value into a variable.

7.Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

A condition is used to test if something is true or not.

8.Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0         // Block one
if spam == 10:   // Block one
	print('eggs')    // Block two
	if spam > 5:     // Block two
		print('bacon')    // Block three
	else:        	// Block two
		print('ham')    // Block three
	print('spam')   // Block two
print('spam')	// Block one

9.Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, 
prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = int(input())
if spam == 1:
	print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
	print("Howdy")
else:
	print("Greetings")

10.What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

Ctrl - C 

11.What is the difference between break and continue?

Break is used to leave a loop early, a continue is used to test the condition again

12.What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)in a for loop?

There is no difference in the output produced.
range(10) loops from 0 - 10
range(0, 10) starts counting from 0 - 10
range(0, 10, 1) Include by what ammount to increment the value

13.Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. 
Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for n in range(1, 10):
	print(n)

n = 1
while(n < 11):
	print(n)
	n++

14.If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how woulsd you call it after importing spam?

Like so:

bacon()
